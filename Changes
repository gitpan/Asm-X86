Revision history for Asm-X86

2009-07-05	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.08:
	  Updated the instruction list from NASM version 2.06. Changed one
	  private procedure's name.

2008-11-09	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.07:
	  Documentation fixes.
	  Verified instruction list to be complete with fasm-1.67.28 and
	  updated it from nasm-2.05.01.

2008-10-24	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.06:
	  Updated instruction list from fasm-1.67.27. Changed double to
	  single quotes in one place.

2008-05-18	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.05:
	  A bit better coding style.
	  Added the tests to the package.

2008-04-17	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.04:
	  Added functions checking if the given string represents a register
	   in AT&T syntax. Renamed the previous functions with an "_intel"
	   suffix and the new functions with an "_att" suffix. Old
	   functions (the ones with no suffixes) now check for either Intel
	   or AT&T syntax, so they remain valid.
	  Added return value to function descriptions.
	  Added arrays with AT&T-style register names.
	  Updated instruction list from the latest FASM source.
	  Added AT&T-style instruction mnemonic array.
	  Added functions for checking if a given string represents a
	   valid 16-/32-/64-bit addressing mode in AT&T syntax.
	   Renamed the previous functions with an "_intel" suffix and the
	   new functions with an "_att" suffix. Old functions (the ones
	   with no suffixes) now check for either Intel or AT&T syntax,
	   so they remain valid.
	  Changed Intel syntax addressing analysis to check if the whole given
	   string is correct (using ^ and $ in regular expressions).
	  Added functions to convert an addressing mode or instruction (with
	   all its operands) between AT&T and Intel syntaxes.
	  Added functions to convert an instruction or memory addressing mode
	   between Intel and AT&T syntaxes.
	  Converted subroutine names to prototypes.
	  Added the compile-once flag where applicable.
	  Added PRIVATE to documentation of private non-exported subroutines.

	* Version 0.03:
	  Fixed a bug with 64-bit addressing, where valid addresses of the
	   form [ebx+r10d] were not recognised properly.
	  Added the "SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION" section from the README file
	   to the module.

2008-03-27	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.02:
	  Fixed a bug with the 'fs' segment register.
	  Added a list of segment registers and a function for checking
	   if a given string represents a segment register.
	  Added functions for checking if a given string represents a
	   valid 16-/32-/64-bit addressing mode.
	  Added a list of FPU registers and a function for checking
	   if a given string represents an FPU register.

2008-03-08	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.01:
	  Includes all known by FASM instruction mnemonics and registers.
	  Includes functions that check if a given string is a register
	  (any type or explicit: 8-, 16-, 32-, 64-bit or multimedia) and
	  functions that check if a given string is a mnemonic.
